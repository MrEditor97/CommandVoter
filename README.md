CommandVoter
============

CommandVoter is a powerful plugin for Minecraft.

This plugin allows you as a server owner to be able to make your server more popular.

> So, what does it do?

* Sends the player a Voting Link when the player performs the command /vote
* Admins and players who have the permissions can use /topvoters to be able to get a list of the top 5 (or how ever many, changeable in the configuration file)
* After a player has voted, they can peform the /rewards command to be able to retreve there reward for there current vote
  * If the player votes twice however, and they don't claim there reward form before. The player isn't going to get there reward for there last vote.
  * Players must have the permission "commandvoter.rewards"
* Customizable rewards
  * Rewards act as a leveling system.
  * If a player has voted 2 times, but the threshold is 5 votes before the player gets a reward then the player will not receive a reward until they have met that threshold
  * When a player has reached the first threshold, a player can be given a reward every time they vote until the next threshold. If the threshold was 10 votes, then the player would have to vote 10 times before being allowed on to the next reward
  * If a player manages to be able to get the your maxium specified vote threshold, don't worry. They will keep on getting rewards, for how ever many times they vote after that. They will get the last specified thresholds votes
